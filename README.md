# Tara Glover - Senior Program Management & IT Operations Leader

Hi! This page is intended to help you understand what it might be like to work with me.

It’s also a well-intentioned effort at building some trust by being intentionally vulnerable, and to share my ideas of a good working relationship to reduce the anxiety of anyone on my team.

At the center of my leadership blueprint is a simple premise:

**Humans drive systems. Not the other way around**

## Not Found On My Resume

I'm a mom of 5, and while that doesn't DEFINE me, parenting certainly informs my perspective. It also ensures I am learning something new every day and is a constant reminder to honor growth in whatever form it may take. 

I was the first in my family to attend college. None of my grandparents made it past fourth grade. Perspective matters to me. So does access.

I’ve spent my career moving from psychobiology to enterprise technology leadership — always fascinated by systems, but even more fascinated by the humans inside them.

I have lived in Maryland my whole life, but my calling is a remote fishing village in the Dominican Republic or some place like it.  

I bake my own bread, compost, and raise chickens and ducks (as pets and egg providers).  So far every animal born on our little homestead has been a boy so things get a little angsty each Spring. Check out my

## My Leadership Blueprint

There is no universal formula for building great teams. Every group is composed of individuals shaped by distinct identities, histories, and lived experiences.

What has consistently worked for me across environments is this triad:

1. Transparency - results in faster answers, broader context, stronger collective ownership, clearer alignment
2. Diversity - across perspectives, backgrounds, cognitive styles, and lived experiences
3. Experimentation - failure in the context of thoughtful experimentation is data

## My Values

I am incredibly passionate about diversity of all kinds, identity, accessibility and belonging. I value honesty, direct communication and authenticity.

## Psychological Safety in Practice

Building safety, especially on remote teams, requires intentional mechanics:

- I default to vulnerability.
- I publicly admit mistakes.
- I keep my calendar open.
- I keep my camera on when possible.
- I listen more than I speak.
- I protect deep work time (especially for engineers).
- I run interference when necessary.
- I allow teams to self-organize where appropriate.
- I give frequent updates so no one wonders where things stand.

## Communication

**Response time**: I will always do my best to provide immediate responses to emails or messages, even if only to acknowledge that the message had been received. Please don't ever hesitate to reach out for a coffee chat, brainstorming session, or anything else with me!

**Asynchronous communication**: I have a strong preference for asynchronous communication and will default to it when possible. While I recognize the importance of a well-defined meeting, I know that quality work comes from people working concurrently on projects and products at the times that work best for them. 

**Synchronous communication**: While I tend to default to async communication as a starting point, I also recognize the importance of synchronous communication in terms of building rapport, trust, and quickly delivering shared context to a group. 
    
## Working with Me

You can expect:

- Directness without hostility
- High expectations without micromanagement
- Authentic Advocacy 
- Honest feedback delivered respectfully

You will rarely wonder where you stand with me.

I deeply value expertise. If you know more than I do about something (and you likely do), I expect to learn from you.

My goal is to clear obstacles, organize all the things, and build and streamline process. In general: to make your (work) life easier, clearer and less stressful. It cannot be overstated how much I value your knowledge and expertise and my desire to learn things from you.  

What's going on in your life doesn't stop just because you're at work. Please don't feel you can't talk about something because it's 'not work related'.
